The purpose of this application is to retrieve hotel deals based on criteria entered by the user.  It consumes a JSON API by Expedia.

Due to experience and familiarity, I used C#.Net MVC3 to develop the application.  The JSON format was converted to models (classes)
to simplify parsing and retrieval.  The main action is invoked on the server upon Find button click.  The action invokes the API and 
renders the page with the form and search results.

Through the exercise, I learned more about the JSON format.
